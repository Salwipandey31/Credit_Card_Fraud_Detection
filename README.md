## 📂 Repository Structure

- **Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb** – Main Colab notebook covering:
  - Data loading & exploration
  - Preprocessing (scaling, handling class imbalance)
  - Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
  - Evaluation: ROC‑AUC, confusion matrix, and performance metrics

- **requirements.txt** – Python package dependencies.

## 🧩 Objectives

1. **Explore** the highly imbalanced dataset (~0.17% fraud cases).
2. **Preprocess**:
   - Scale features
   - Use techniques like SMOTE to address class imbalance
3. **Train** classification models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest).
4. **Evaluate** using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC‑AUC, and confusion matrices.
5. **Visualize** insights from data and model performance.

🎯 Key Highlights
⏱️ Balances speed and accuracy using scalable preprocessing and modeling techniques.

🧠 Handles class imbalance via SMOTE.

✅ Evaluates models focusing on recall & precision due to dataset skew.

📊 Visualizations: includes ROC curve plots and confusion matrices to interpret results.

📈 Results
High ROC‑AUC scores (~0.98+), indicating strong model discrimination.

Confusion matrices help identify false positives vs. false negatives.

Precision/Recall trade-off analysis included for optimal threshold tuning.
